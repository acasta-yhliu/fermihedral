Code for paper _Fermihedral: On the Optimal Compilation for Fermion-to-Qubit Encoding_

## Dependency

To replicate our experiments, please at least have

1. Python 3.9+ for this project
2. For compiling the SAT solver `kissat`: `gcc` or `clang` and `make` are required.

## Execute

To prepare the environment, execute `python3 prepare.py`, it will create the virtual environment, install packages and `kissat`.

To obtain the results in one run, refer to the notebook `singleshot.ipynb`. Follow the cells and you will get the results. Please make sure you are using the virtual environment created by `prepare.sh` so that you have all packages loaded.
